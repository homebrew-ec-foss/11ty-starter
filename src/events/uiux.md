Imagine opening a website with a long loading time, an unresponsive layout, plain old boring text and pictures, and is a pain to navigate through. 
(We're looking at you, IRCTCðŸ‘€).

Good design speaks a thousand words, and a good User Interface and User Experience speak volumes. 

On that note, HackerSpace PESUECC brings forth a golden opportunity to learn the a-b-c of design with our **two-day** UI/UX Product Design Workshop. âœ¨
